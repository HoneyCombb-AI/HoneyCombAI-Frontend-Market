    question: "What to expect on the 30-min demo call?",
    answer:
      "During the call, we'll upload the accounts you're currently working on. Within just 30 minutes, you'll see a full view of Honeycomb in action, complete with account details, signals, and insights tailored to your pipeline.",

    value: "item-2",
    question: "Will it work for my ICP / Accounts?",
    answer:
      "Of course. Honeycomb is designed to work with any ICP or account list. We pull data from across the internet, so as long as your accounts have an online presence, Honeycomb will find relevant signals and insights for them.",
  },
  {
    value: "item-3",
    question: "What kind of signals can you find?",
    answer:
      "Any signal that matters to you. Unlike most tools that limit you to 5â€“10 pre-set triggers (like funding, M&A, or job changes), Honeycomb tracks anything available on the internet, so you're never boxed in.",
